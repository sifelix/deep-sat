# Paired Notebooks

In this project, Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are paired with Python scripts (`python/*.py`). Thus, modifying one of these files will also
update the other. For more information about paired notebooks, see [jupytext documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-server.html#paired-notebooks).
